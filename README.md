This is the repository of my workings in 3D printing.
The printer I used is Ender 3.

# Process of 3D Printing
1. Firstly you need to select the 3D Model and you can do that by creating your own 3D model using Solidworks or AutoCad ,or you can select and download one from Thingiverse.com it is a really cool website where you can find many 3D models ofuseful and antique things.
2. As you may know the file extension of 3d file id .stl and this will be used now to print in our 3D printer.
3. Here we need to do slicing of the model to create a .gcode(geometric code) file to serve to 3d printer.
4. Wait here before going to the part of slicing i want to tell you that while creating an actual 3d model we are going to give some type of material to the printer that will be like an ink and paper to normal printer and that material will be plastic.
5. There are many types of filamet we can use i.e. PLA or ABS,etc(I used PLA).
6. The printing is dome in Layer by Layer format in such a way that we create layers of bricks while constructing a house but here instead of bricks we are going to use melted plastic i.e. filament.
7. So now you may understand why we need a .gcode file? Because it is the movement of the nozzle in the printable area for the perfect output.
8. And voala! That is the very basic of how 3D printer works.
